# Sight Words Trainer - Rainbow Levels App Documentation

## Overview
This is a progressive sight words learning application with 8 color-coded levels (Red through Light Blue). Students master words through study, review, and testing phases to earn badges.

## Core Architecture

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Single-file application containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `CNAME` - GitHub Pages custom domain configuration
- `README.md` - Basic project information

### Key Components

#### 1. Level System
```javascript
const LEVELS = [
  { name:'Red', color:'#ef4444', badge:'üçì', words:[...] },
  { name:'Orange', color:'#f97316', badge:'üçä', words:[...] },
  // ... 8 total levels
];
```

#### 2. State Management
- **Storage**: Uses `localStorage` with key `'sightwords_rainbow_v3'`
- **State Structure**: 
  - `perLevel`: Array of level data with word progress
  - `levelIdx`: Current level index
  - `phase`: Current phase ('study', 'review', 'final', 'prefinal', 'postreview')
  - `studentName`: Student's name
  - `reviewMode`: 'current' or 'general'

#### 3. Word Progress Tracking
Each word tracks:
- `seen`, `correct`, `wrong`: Basic counters
- `streak`: Current correct streak
- `mastered`: Boolean for mastery status
- `tricky`: Boolean for difficult words
- `lastSeenTimestamp`: Date of last appearance
- `masteryDates`: Array of correct answer dates
- `sessionsSeen`: Number of sessions word appeared in

## User Flow

### 1. Initial Load
- **No Student Name**: Shows welcome modal to enter name and practice mode
- **Has Student Name**: Shows "Welcome back" modal with three options:
  - Continue current level
  - Choose different level  
  - Review all known words

### 2. Study Phase
- **First Pass**: Shows each word once before repeats
- **Weighted Selection**: Uses unified pool system prioritizing:
  - Words not seen in 7+ days (critical)
  - Words with wrong answers
  - Tricky words
  - Cross-level review (previous levels)

### 3. Review Phase
- **Trigger**: When ALL words in level are mastered
- **Process**: Each word appears twice in random order
- **Success**: Shows "Review" + "Retest" options
- **Failure**: Returns to study mode with missed words marked tricky

### 4. Test Phase
- **Trigger**: After successful review or direct selection
- **Process**: Each word appears once
- **Success (100%)**: Shows celebration animation + "Next Level" + "Choose Level" options
- **Failure**: Shows "Quick Review" option

## Key Functions

### Core Functions
- `nextWord()`: Main word selection logic
- `markRight()` / `markWrong()`: Handle user responses
- `pickFromUnifiedPool()`: Advanced word selection algorithm
- `checkMastery()`: Determines if word is mastered
- `showWelcomeBack()`: Creates welcome modal
- `openPreFinal()`: Shows review/retest options

### Modal Functions
- `showReviewSuccessModal()`: After successful review
- `endTestAndShowResults()`: After test completion
- `showBadgeCelebration()`: Badge earning animation

## Learning Science Features

### Mastery Requirements
- **Streak**: 3 correct answers in a row
- **Sessions**: Word must appear in 1+ session
- **Time Span**: 0 days between first and last correct (same-day mastery allowed)

### Spacing & Review
- **Critical Review**: Words not seen in 7+ days get highest priority
- **Retry Logic**: Failed words appear after 3 other words
- **Cross-Level Review**: Previous level words included based on review mode

### Streak Counter (General Review Mode)
- **Visual Bar**: 20 segments that fill as streak increases
- **Streak Range**: 0 to 22 (capped at 22 for challenge)
- **Glow Effect**: Appears when bar fills completely (streak 20)
- **Rainbow Effect**: Appears after maintaining full bar for 2 more correct answers (streak 22)
- **Gentle Penalty**: Wrong answers only reduce streak by 1 segment
- **Reset on Entry**: Streak resets to middle (10) when entering general review mode

### Review Modes
- **Current Level Focus**: Prioritizes current level, minimal previous level inclusion
- **General Review**: Shows only mastered words from ALL levels (Red through Light Blue), with enhanced tricky word priority for retention. Uses dedicated word selection logic that bypasses current-level restrictions.
