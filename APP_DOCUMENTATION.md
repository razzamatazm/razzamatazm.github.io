# Rainbow Words Trainer - Technical Documentation

## Overview
A progressive sight words learning application with 8 color-coded levels (Red through Light Blue). Students master words through study, review, and testing phases to earn badges. Features intelligent word selection, cross-level retention, and backup/restore capabilities.

## Core Architecture

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Single-file application containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `CNAME` - GitHub Pages custom domain configuration
- `README.md` - User-facing project information
- `APP_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Technical documentation (this file)

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Storage**: LocalStorage API
- **Animations**: CSS keyframes and transitions
- **Mobile**: Web Share API, Clipboard API
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static site)

## State Management

### Storage Key
`'sightwords_rainbow_v3'` in localStorage

### State Structure
```javascript
{
  perLevel: [
    {
      words: [
        {
          text: 'the',
          seen: 5,
          correct: 3,
          wrong: 1,
          streak: 2,
          mastered: false,
          tricky: true,
          lastSeenTimestamp: Date,
          masteryDates: [Date, Date],
          sessionsSeen: 2,
          currentSessionSeen: false
        }
      ],
      badgeEarned: false
    }
  ],
  levelIdx: 0,
  phase: 'study',
  studentName: 'Student',
  reviewMode: 'current',
  reviewStreak: 10,
  seenTotal: 25,
  currentSessionId: 'uuid',
  // ... additional state fields
}
```

### Key State Variables

- `phase`: 'study' | 'review' | 'final' | 'prefinal' | 'postreview'
- `reviewMode`: 'current' | 'general'
- `reviewStreak`: Streak counter for general review mode (0-22)

## Level System

### 8 Rainbow Levels
```javascript
const LEVELS = [
  { name:'Red', color:'#ef4444', badge:'üçì', words:[...12 words] },
  { name:'Orange', color:'#f97316', badge:'üçä', words:[...10 words] },
  { name:'Yellow', color:'#eab308', badge:'üåª', words:[...13 words] },

];
```

## User Flow

### Initial Load

#### New User
1. Shows welcome modal with app overview
2. Explains Level Mode vs Review Mode
3. Provides quick tips (tap zones, keyboard shortcuts, profile access)
4. User enters name and clicks "Let's Start!"
5. Shows level picker to choose starting level

#### Returning User
1. Shows "Welcome back, [Name]!" modal
2. Displays three options:
   - **Continue Current Level**: Shows current level with progress
   - **Choose Level**: Opens level picker
   - ~~**Review All Known Words**: Switches to general review~~ (removed - now in level picker)
3. Auto-suggests lowest unpassed level

### Study Phase

#### Word Selection Logic
Uses `pickFromUnifiedPool()` with two-tier system:

**TIER 1: Critical Reviews** (highest priority)
- Words not seen in 5+ days from any level
- Ensures long-term retention

**TIER 2: Weighted Selection**
- **Current Level Words**: Base weight 25 + time/tricky bonuses
- **Previous Level Tricky Words**: Base weight 12 √ó recency multiplier
- **Previous Level Mastered Words**: Base weight 5-7 √ó recency multiplier
- **Recency Multiplier**: Recent levels weighted higher (1.0 ‚Üí 0.6 ‚Üí 0.4...)

#### Target Distribution (Current Level Mode)
- **70%** current level words
- **15%** tricky words from previous levels
- **15%** mastered words from previous levels
- **(80/20 if no tricky words)**

#### Cross-Level Review
- Always includes mastered and tricky words from previous levels
- No day threshold - works same-day
- Weighted by level distance (recent levels prioritized)

### Review Phase

#### Trigger
When ALL words in level are mastered (100% mastery required)

#### Process
1. **First Review**: Each word appears once
2. **If any missed**:
   - Shows score modal
   - Restarts review with sequence:
     - Missed words (1x at beginning)
     - Correct words (1x in middle)
     - Missed words (1x at end)
   - Marks missed words as tricky
3. **Repeat until 100% correct**
4. **Then offer**: Review again or take test

### Test Phase

#### Trigger
- After successful review, OR
- Direct selection from modal

#### Process
- Each word appears once in random order
- No second chances during test

#### Results
- **100%**: Badge earned! Confetti celebration + "Next Level" + "Choose Level"
- **<100%**: Shows score, missed words, offers "Quick Review" or "Test" again

## Mastery System

### Requirements (ALL must be met)
1. **Streak**: 2 correct answers in a row
2. **Sessions**: Word seen in 1+ session
3. **Time Span**: 0 days (same-day mastery allowed)
4. **Mastery Dates**: At least 2 recorded correct answers

### Constants
```javascript
MASTERY_STREAK_REQUIRED = 2      // 2 correct in a row
MASTERY_SESSIONS_REQUIRED = 1    // 1 session minimum
MASTERY_TIME_SPAN_DAYS = 0       // Same-day mastery allowed
```

### Tricky Word System

#### Becomes Tricky When:
1. Gets wrong **2+ times total** during practice
2. Missed during a review session
3. Missed during a test

#### Stops Being Tricky When:
- Gets correct **5 times in a row**

#### Constants
```javascript
TRICKY_ADD_AFTER_WRONGS = 2      // 2 misses ‚Üí tricky
TRICKY_REMOVE_AFTER_STREAK = 5   // 5 streak ‚Üí remove tricky
```

#### Behavior
- Tricky words get higher weight in selection
- Always included in cross-level review
- Don't block test eligibility (only current level mastery counts)

## Learning Science

### Weighted Selection Algorithm

#### Current Level Mode
```
Current Level Word Weight:
  base = 1 + (wrong √ó 4) - streak
  base += 25 (current level boost)
  base += timeBoost (days since seen √ó 0.8, max 10)
  if tricky: base += 8
  
Previous Level Word Weight:
  recencyMultiplier = max(0.2, 1 - (levelDistance √ó 0.2))
  
  If tricky:
    base += 12 √ó recencyMultiplier
    base += timeBoost √ó recencyMultiplier
  
  If mastered:
    base += (hasTrickyWords ? 5 : 7) √ó recencyMultiplier
    base += timeBoost √ó recencyMultiplier
```

#### General Review Mode
- All mastered words from all levels
- Enhanced tricky word priority (+5 boost)
- Time-based boost for words not seen recently
- No current level preference

### Spaced Repetition
- **Critical threshold**: 5 days (words not seen get highest priority)
- **Review threshold**: 2 days (for tricky words)
- **History blocking**: Prevents same word appearing too frequently
- **Retry delay**: 3 words between retry attempts

### Session Tracking
- Each session gets unique ID
- Tracks which words seen in current session
- Prevents duplicate counting
- Resets on level switch or app reload

## UI Design Patterns

### Color System
```css
--bg: #0f1115 (dark background)
--panel: #1a1d24 (card background)
--fg: #e5e7eb (text)
--muted: #9ca3af (secondary text)
--accent: #6ea8fe (blue accent)
--success: #2effaa (green success)
```

### Rainbow Colors (in order)

2. Orange: #f97316
3. Yellow: #eab308
4. Green: #22c55e
5. Blue: #3b82f6
6. Purple: #a855f7
7. Pink: #ec4899
8. Cyan: #38bdf8

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px
- Desktop: ‚â• 768px

- **Badge Celebration**: 3-second display with confetti
- **Streak Glow**: Pulsing glow at streak 20+
- **Rainbow Chase**: Color cycling at streak 22+

## Import/Export System

### Export Format
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exportDate": "2025-10-08T12:00:00.000Z",
  "studentName": "Student Name",
  "data": { /* full state object */ }
}
```

### Export Behavior
- **Mobile**: Tries native share sheet first, falls back to clipboard
- **Desktop**: Downloads JSON file
- **Filename**: `rainbow-words-{studentName}-{date}.json`

### Import Behavior
1. User selects file or pastes JSON
2. Validates data structure
3. Shows confirmation modal with student name and export date
4. Warns about replacing current progress
5. On confirm: Replaces all state and refreshes UI

### Mobile Optimizations
- Web Share API for native sharing
- Clipboard API for easy copy/paste
- File input for backup file selection
- Touch-friendly button sizes

6. **Event Listeners**: At bottom of script
7. **Boot**: Initialization at very end

### Best Practices
- Always call `saveState()` after state changes
- Update UI after state changes (updateHeader, updateProgressBars, etc.)
- Use `console.log()` for debugging key functions
- Validate data before importing
- Handle null elements gracefully
